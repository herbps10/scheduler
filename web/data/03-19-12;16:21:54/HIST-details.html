</TR>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="ntdefault">
This course approaches the long cultural and social history of Europe from a multi-cultural perspective, crossing national as well as disciplinary boundaries.  Beginning with the pre-Christian period, it surveys the development of local customs and identities in the context of an array of political entities.  Then it explores the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and how ethnic and religious minorities have fared as a result.  This leads through the Holocaust to discussion of the many ethnic tensions in today's Europe.  Students participate actively in the discussion of these issues, and each explores an ethnic identity in a paper based in part on an oral history project.  Offered not on a regular basis

This will be a three week course taught in the British Isles. Historically, the term British Isles" - a term which suggests both unity and harmony - is problematic. Although England, Ireland, Wales and Scotland have been at various times politically tied to one another, their relations have often been fraught with tension and conflict. Ireland's contentious relationship to England is, of course, well-known. Less obvious, but no less significant, are the tensions that exist amongst the Welsh, the Scots, the Cornish, and subjects from around Britain's former world empire, over what it means to be British. This course seeks to provide students with an understanding of the complexities inherent in the relationships between the nations and peoples that inhabit the British Isles.

From the middle of the 15th century through the end of the 18th, European explorers, adventurers, traders, and settlers swarmed into virtually all corners of the globe.  This mass migration of Europeans wrought immense changes, the repercussions of which continue to haunt us today.  This course proceeds roughly chronologically, focusing on characteristic moments of contact, exchange, conflict, and transformation.  Topics that we will explore include: the motives for European exploration and expansion; attempts (both successful and failed) at cross-cultural communication; the effects of European conquest and colonization on native populations; the legacies of the age of exploration in terms of human and biological ecology, social structures, and culture; the impacts of contact and settlement on European political systems and mentalities; and the significance of early manifestations of the modern global economy and culture of consumerism.

The reign of the Tudor and Stuart monarchs saw sustained and deep-reaching changes in the four nations of the British Isles (England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales).  Over just two centuries, this region witnessed divisive processes of religious transformation associated with the Protestant Reformation; the absorption of the peoples of the "Celtic fringe" into a centralized and bureaucratized nation state based in London two separate political revolutions and series of bitterly fought rebellions in Scotland and Ireland the transformation of the British Isles from a relatively weak and marginal region into a global economic and military power and particularly vibrant British contributions to literature and the arts, philosophy, and the sciences.

This course examines slave rebellions and resistance in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in a wide variety of locales, including the United States, the Caribbean, and South America.  Our goals will be to examine what constitutes a slave rebellion, how resistance differed from rebellion, how revolts were organized, how they impacted local communities as well as nation-states, and how various forms of resistance altered slaveholder power.  This course will give you a sense of what slavery was like in the New World, and how historical events, such as the French and Haitian revolutions, altered slave regimes, and how slave rebels shaped the abolitionist movement.  In addition, we will explore how historians have interpreted the fragmentary evidence on revolts and conspiracies. Prerequisites: HIST 220 and HIST 221 or permission of the instructor.

</TR>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="ntdefault">
This course will focus on the post-World War II African-American experience, with particular attention to national, state, and local policies and to northern and western urban centers.  We will examine the basis for structural inequality side-by-side with Black activism and alternate visions for Black communities and the country.  Traditional narratives of the post-World War II era have emphasized the southern Civil Rights Movement ending in Black Power, white backlash, and urban de-industrialization and decline.  In the past decade, historians have collectively challenged that framework and emphasis, illustrating, for example, that governmental policies which privileged whites and reinforced segretation pre-dated the southern movement and did not simply emerge in response to the angry and violent rhetoric of Black Power.  Moreover, through Norhtern-based local studies historians have effectively illustrated that the dichotomies of South versus North and Civil Rights versus Black Power are far too simplistic, obscuring both long-term Black activism outside the South and the common roots and bases for Civil Rights and Black Power.  We will explore these and other issues related to the post-World War II Black Freedom Struggle in the North and West and the interrelated themes of structural inequality and white privilege through our reading.
