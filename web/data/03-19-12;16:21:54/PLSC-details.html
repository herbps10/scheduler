State failure presents serious problems for the international community.

This course surveys the literature on state formation and collapse, with particular emphasis on causes and consequences, detailed examinations of individual cases, and the international community's response.  A case study approach will be employed, focusing on four states (possibilities include Rwanda, Somalia, Congo, Afghanistan, Yugoslavia, Sri Lanka, Colombia, and other states should events warrant).  By examining the various processes at work in failed states, the international response, and the tools for reconstruction, we will draw conclusions regarding the potential for early warning systems and appropriate policy remedies.

</TR>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="ntdefault">
Democracy as both a political ideal and institutionalized system is relatively new in historical terms: the eighteenth century counted only three such polities (The US, the French Republic, and the Swiss Cantons). This number has increased steadily over time, even leading some to predict a trend toward near-total democratization globally. In what is termed the third wave of democratization, over 80 countries around the world have moved from authoritarian to democratic systems, albeit sometimes slowly and in partial measure, just since the mid-1970s.  However, there is no single clear path toward democratization, and the methods for - or even possibility of - assisting countries toward democratic goals remains a topic of acute political controversy.

How successful have the countries of the region been in addressing the political and socioeconomic aspirations of their populations?  Which countries have emerged as regional or global powers, and with what effect on the international system?  Two major Asian powers, China and Japan, are studied in detail, and the considerable diversity of the region is explored through additional country studies.  In addition, each student has the opportunity to pursue study of a pertinent topic of special interest throughout the individual project requirement.

We then turn to the ways in which newly independent states have contended with challenges of governance, national unity, and socioeconomic development, through case studies of the states of the region.

What special obstacles do civil wars present for conflict resolution?  What means exist for countries caught in civil war to reach acceptable resolutions, re-assert the rule of law and accountability, and allow their societies to overcome divisions and reconcile?
