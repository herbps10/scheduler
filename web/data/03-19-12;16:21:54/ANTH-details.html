</TR>

<TD CLASS="ntdefault">
This course has two broad aims.  One is to introduce students to the field of cultural anthropology by paying close attention to what anthropologists do and how they do it.  The other is to explore some of the ways in which people organize their lives and construct systems of meaning -- from kin relations and gender roles to economic systems and marriage patterns, religion and healing.  In the process, we will be challenged to think about the value of cultural diversity in an increasingly interconnected world and to see ourselves from others' point of view.
